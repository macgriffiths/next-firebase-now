# A basic next.js example of using server *and* client side firebase

I created this to make a "vanilla" Now/Firebase example because I can't seem to get an app that uses firebase to deploy to the Now 2.0 platform. After seeing some posts in spectrum.chat on the subject I decided to make a basic repo with the goal of providing an example for those who want to see source.

## Current status: 
I get broken deployments and cannot run on Zeit Now 2.0. I can run locally using `dev` script.

## Goal: 
Get an app that uses `firebase` and `firebase-admin` libraries to deploy on Now 2.0.

## TLDR;
- `yarn dev` works, I get an app
- `now` results in borked deploy
